== Snow Watchr

Scrapes a CT news station's snow closings webpage for specific terms and prints them to the console and sends them to your phone via prowl.

This should be fairly easy to modify for any other news station. Just tweak the site URL and regex to find what you are looking for!

You can also tweak how it notifies you by modifying the post command in send_message.
